This is the repository with the whole code.

Deployed frontend link: https://frontend-swwtf.ondigitalocean.app/
Deployed backend link: https://eventease-v4kuo.ondigitalocean.app/

I have errors on loading stuff to the frontend even though I can access the database created on DO. 
Some of the errors I had are:

Access to fetch at 'https://eventease-v4kuo.ondigitalocean.app/backend/api/categories' from origin 'https://frontend-swwtf.ondigitalocean.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED

I also created the pull request with reviewer, however I had to have some of those stuff pushed on github to test the deployed app. I merged the pull request on my own. It didn't help much.
